<p><b>Note: this page is work in progress, as is the software described here. We are at
the moment preparing for a very first beta version of Lab::Measurement. The old, "stable" 
code (called Lab::VISA) can be found at <a href="http://www.labvisa.de/">http://www.labvisa.de/</a>.</b></p>

<p>Lab::Measurement allows to perform test and measurement tasks with Perl
scripts. It provides an interface to several instrumentation control backends,
as e.g. <a href="http://linux-gpib.sourceforge.net/">Linux-GPIB</a> or National Instruments' <a
href="http://sine.ni.com/psp/app/doc/p/id/psp-411">NI-VISA library</a>.
Dedicated instrument driver classes relieve the user from taking care
for internal details and make data aquisition as easy as
<pre class="titleclaim">$voltage = $multimeter-&gt;read_voltage();</pre>
</p>

<p>The Lab::Measurement software stack comprises several parts that are built
on top of each other. This modularization allows support for a wide range of hardware
on different operating systems.</p>

<p>
As hardware drivers vary in API details, each supported one is encapsulated into perl modules
of types <i>Lab::Bus</i> and <i>Lab::Connection</i>. If your measurement script works under Linux 
with Lab::Connection::LinuxGPIB, it will also work with Lab::Connection::VISA. Normally you won't 
have to care about this; at most, your Instrument object (see below) gets different initialization
parameters.
</p>

<p>
A typical measurement script is based on the 
high-level interface provided by the modules <i>Lab::Instrument</i> and <i>Lab::Measurement</i>. 
The former silently handles all the protocol overhead. You can just write commands to an instrument
and read the result. Drivers for specific devices are included, implementing their command
syntax (e.g. set_voltage(...)); more can easily be added to provide additional high-level functions. 
The latter includes tools for metadata handling (what was that amplifier setting in the measurement
again?!), plotting, and similar.
</p>

<p>These classes together are distributed as the Lab::Measurement system.
Designed to make data aquisition fun!</p>

<h2>How to obtain</h2>
<p>
Lab::Measurement is free software and can be <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Lab-Measurement/">downloaded 
from CPAN</a>. The <a href="https://www.gitorious.org/lab-measurement/">source code archive is 
hosted at Gitorious</a>, where you can also obtain the newest pre-release code and 
browse the version history. If you would like to contribute, just send us your patches, 
merge requests, ... :)
</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>Quite some <a href="docs/index.html">documentation of Lab::Measurement</a>
(<a href="docs/documentation.pdf">PDF format</a>) is available. This
documentation includes a <a href="docs/Tutorial.html">tutorial on
using Lab::Measurement</a> (outdated). Detailed <a href="docs/installation.html">installation
instructions</a> are provided as well. In addition, there's also a collection
of <a href="backends.html">back-end specific documentation and links</a>.
</p>
<p>There is a <a
    href="https://www-mailman.uni-regensburg.de/mailman/listinfo/lab-visa-users">mailing
list (lab-visa-users)</a> set up for Lab::VISA and Lab::Measurement. This mailing list is the
right place to give feedback and ask for help.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>
<p>Although this software has been used for years in real world
measurements by its developers, it remains work in progress. Please bear
with us while we constantly improve code and documentation.</p>

<p>Lab::Measurement is currently developed and employed at <a
    href="http://www.nano.physik.uni-muenchen.de/">nanophysics
group, LMU M&uuml;nchen</a> and <a
    href="http://www.physik.uni-regensburg.de/forschung/strunk/">mesoscopic
physics group, Uni Regensburg</a>. Users have reported further applications
in academic and industrial r&amp;d environments.</p>

<h2>Authors and history</h2>
<p>The Lab::VISA system was originally developed by <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/~schroeer/">Daniel Schr&ouml;er</a> and
continued by <a href="http://www.akhuettel.de/">Andreas K.
H&uuml;ttel</a>, Daniela Taubert, and Daniel Schr&ouml;er. Most of the documentation was
written by Daniel Schr&ouml;er. In 2011, the code was refactored mostly by Florian Olbrich
to include the Bus and Connection layers; subsequently the name of the entire package collection
was changed to Lab::Measurement.
