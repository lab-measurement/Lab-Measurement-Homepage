<h1>Lab::VISA</h1>

<p>Lab::VISA allows to perform test and measurement tasks with Perl
scripts. It provides an interface to National Instruments' <a
    href="http://sine.ni.com/psp/app/doc/p/id/psp-411">NI-VISA
library</a>, making the standard VISA calls available from within Perl
programs. Dedicated instrument driver classes relieve the user from
taking care for internal details and make data aquisition as easy as</p>

<pre class="titleclaim">$voltage = $multimeter-&gt;read_voltage();</pre>

<p>The Lab::VISA software stack comprises three parts that are built
on top of each other and provide increasing comfort. Your measurement
scripts can be based on any of these stages.</p>

<p>The lowest level is Lab::VISA. It makes the NI-VISA library
accessible from Perl and thus allows to make any standard VISA call.</p>

<p>The modules in the Lab::Instrument package make communicating
with instruments easier by silently handling the protocol overhead
involved.</p>

<p>Package Lab::Tools is the highest abstraction layer. These
modules provide support for writing good measurement scripts. They offer
means of saving data and related meta information to disk, plotting data
etc.</p>

<p>These packages together are referred to as the Lab::VISA system.
Encapsulating the complexity of VISA calls into a straightforward to use
library, the Lab::VISA system is designed to make you happy.</p>

<h2>How to obtain</h2>
<p>The packages are free software and can be downloaded from CPAN.
Follow these links for</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Lab-VISA/">Lab::VISA</a>,</li>
    <li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Lab-Instrument/">Lab::Instrument</a>,
    and</li>

</ul>

<h2>Latest news</h2>
<ul>
    <li>15.4.2010: Lab::Instrument and Lab::Tools have been updated
    on CPAN! In the case of Lab::Tools, this is just a small bugfix; as
    for Lab::Instrument, functionality has been extended a lot with many
    more drivers and features. USB and network (TCP) devices are working
    now, and devices attached to an Oxford Instruments IsoBus are
    supported!</li>
    <li>31.3.2010: Lab::VISA and Lab::Tools have both been updated
    on CPAN. This should fix the NULL-byte bug in Lab::VISA and
    installation problems (missing script files) in Lab::Tools.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>Quite some <a href="docs/toc.html">documentation is available
online in HTML</a> and <a href="docs/documentation.pdf">PDF format</a>. This
documentation contains a <a href="docs/Tutorial.html">tutorial on
using Lab::VISA</a> and a description of the various APIs.</p>

<p>Additionally, a <a
    href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/SCHROEER/Lab-VISA-2.03/Tutorial/Talk/Lab-VISA.ppt">powerpoint
presentation</a> is contained in the Lab::VISA package, and is <a
    href="Lab-VISA-talk.pdf">available online as PDF</a>. The <a
    href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/SCHROEER/Lab-VISA-2.03/Tutorial/Talk">examples</a>
shown in the presentation are contained in the package as well.</p>

<p>There is a mailing list set up for Lab::VISA (<a
    href="https://www-mailman.uni-regensburg.de/mailman/listinfo/lab-visa-users">lab-visa-users
mailing list</a>). This mailing list is the right place to give feedback and
ask for help.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>
<p>Although this software has been used for years in real world
measurements by its developers, it remains work in progress. Please bear
with us while we constantly improve code and documentation.</p>

<p>Lab::VISA is currently developed and employed at <a
    href="http://www.nano.physik.uni-muenchen.de/">nanophysics
group, LMU M&uuml;nchen</a> and <a
    href="http://www.physik.uni-regensburg.de/forschung/strunk/">mesoscopic
physics group, Uni Regensburg</a>. Users have reported further applications
in academic and industrial r&amp;d environments.</p>

<h2>Authors</h2>
<p>The Lab::VISA system was originally developed by <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/~schroeer/">Daniel Schr&ouml;er</a> and
is currently continued by <a href="http://www.akhuettel.de/">Andreas
K. H&uuml;ttel</a> and Daniel Schr&ouml;er. Most of the documentation was
written by Daniel Schr&ouml;er.</p>
