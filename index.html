<h1>Lab::VISA</h1>

	<div id="camelgraph"><img src="camel.png" width="300px" alt="" /></div>
	<p>The Perl packages <em>Lab::VISA</em>, <em>Lab::Instrument</em>, and <em>Lab::Tools</em>
offer instrument and measurement control from Perl via National
Instrument's VISA library. Encapsulating the complexity of VISA calls
into a straightforward to use library, they are designed to make any lab
power user happy.</p>

<h2>How to obtain</h2>
<p>The packages are free software and can be downloaded from CPAN. Follow
these links for</p><ul>
	<li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Lab-VISA/">Lab::VISA</a>,</li>
	<li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Lab-Instrument/">Lab::Instrument</a>, and</li>
	<li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Lab-Tools/">Lab::Tools.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>Quite some <a href="docs/toc.html">documentation is available online in HTML</a> and <a href="docs/documentation.pdf">PDF format</a>.
This documentation starts with a general introduction into using <em>Lab::VISA</em> and continues with a description of the various APIs.</p>

<p>Additionally, a powerpoint presentation is contained in the <em>Lab::VISA</em> package, and is
<a href="Lab-VISA-talk.pdf">available online as PDF</a>. 
The examples discussed in the presentation can be found in the 'Tutorial' directory of Lab::VISA. These examples were run
in realtime during the original talk.</p>

<p>There is a mailing list set up for Lab::VISA (<a
	href="https://www-mailman.uni-regensburg.de/mailman/listinfo/lab-visa-users">lab-visa-users
mailing list</a>). This mailing list is also the right place to give feedback
and ask for help.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>
<p>Although this software has been used for years in real world measurements by its developers,
it remains work in progress. Please bear with us while we constantly improve code and documentation.</p>
<p>Lab::VISA is currently developed at <a href="http://www.nano.physik.uni-muenchen.de/">nanophysics
group, LMU M&uuml;nchen</a> and <a
	href="http://www.physik.uni-regensburg.de/forschung/strunk/">mesoscopic physics group, Uni
Regensburg</a>. Users have reported further uses in academic and industrial r&amp;d environments.</p>

<h2>Authors</h2>
<p>Lab::VISA and friends were originally developed by Daniel Schr&ouml;er and are currently continued by <a
	href="http://www.akhuettel.de/">Andreas K. H&uuml;ttel</a> and Daniel Schr&ouml;er. Most of the documentation was written by Daniel Schr&ouml;er.</p>

<h2>Latest news</h2>
<ul>
	<li>15.4.2010: Lab::Instrument and Lab::Tools have been updated on CPAN!
	In the case of Lab::Tools, this is just a small bugfix; as for Lab::Instrument, 
	functionality has been extended a lot with many more drivers and features. 
	USB and network (TCP) devices are working now, and devices attached to an
	Oxford Instruments IsoBus are supported!</li>
	<li>31.3.2010: Lab::VISA and Lab::Tools have both been updated on
	CPAN. This should fix the NULL-byte bug in Lab::VISA and installation
	problems (missing script files) in Lab::Tools.</li>
