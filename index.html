<p><b>Note: this page is work in progress, as is the software described here. We are at
the moment preparing for a very first beta version of Lab::Measurement. The old, "stable" 
relase (called Lab::VISA) can be found at <a href="http://www.labvisa.de/">http://www.labvisa.de/</a>.</b></p>

<p>Lab::Measurement allows to perform test and measurement tasks with Perl
scripts. It provides an interface to several instrumentation control backends,
as e.g. <a href="http://linux-gpib.sourceforge.net/">Linux-GPIB</a> or National Instruments' <a
href="http://sine.ni.com/psp/app/doc/p/id/psp-411">NI-VISA library</a>.
Dedicated instrument driver classes relieve the user from taking care
for internal details and make data aquisition as easy as
<pre class="titleclaim">$voltage = $multimeter-&gt;read_voltage();</pre>
</p>

<p>The Lab::Measurement software stack comprises four parts that are built
on top of each other and provide increasing comfort. Measurement scripts
can be based on any of these stages.</p>

<p>The lowest level is the device driver library or Perl binding. Lab::VISA, 
distributed here, makes the NI-VISA library accessible from Perl and thus allows 
to make any standard VISA call. This way, a wide variety of devices can be addressed. 
Installation of NI-VISA is straightforward on Windows but can be VERY cumbersome on recent 
Linux variants. Therefore, other independently developed drivers such as Linux-GPIB, 
the de-facto standard for addressing GPIB devices under Linux, can also be used;
support for more backends is being developed.
</p>

<p>
As the backends vary in API details, each of these is encapsulated into a perl module 
of type Lab::Connection. Imagine a Connection as a bus, or a GPIB cable. All measurement 
devices on one cable share a Connection, passing commands and data to and from the computer. 
If your measurement script works under Linux with Lab::Connection::GPIB, 
it will also work with Lab::Connection::VISA by just instantiating a different Connection 
object.
</p>

<p>
The modules in the Lab::Instrument package make communication
with instruments easier by silently handling the protocol overhead.
Drivers for specific devices are included; more can easily be added to 
provide high-level functions. Package Lab::Tools is the highest abstraction layer and is
intended to support writing better measurement scripts. The modules in
this package offer means to log and plot data and its related meta
information.
</p>

<p>These packages together are referred to as the Lab::Measurement system.
Designed to make data aquisition fun!</p>

<h2>How to obtain</h2>
<p>The packages are free software and can be downloaded from CPAN.

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>Quite some <a href="docs/index.html">documentation of Lab::Measurement</a>
(<a href="docs/documentation.pdf">PDF format</a>) is available. This
documentation includes a <a href="docs/Tutorial.html">tutorial on
using Lab::VISA</a> (outdated). Detailed <a href="docs/installation.html">installation
instructions</a> are provided as well. In addition, there's also a collection
of <a href="backends.html">back-end specific documentation and links</a>.
</p>
<p>There is a <a
    href="https://www-mailman.uni-regensburg.de/mailman/listinfo/lab-visa-users">mailing
list (lab-visa-users)</a> set up for Lab::VISA. This mailing list is the
right place to give feedback and ask for help.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>
<p>Although this software has been used for years in real world
measurements by its developers, it remains work in progress. Please bear
with us while we constantly improve code and documentation.</p>

<p>Lab::Measurement is currently developed and employed at <a
    href="http://www.nano.physik.uni-muenchen.de/">nanophysics
group, LMU M&uuml;nchen</a> and <a
    href="http://www.physik.uni-regensburg.de/forschung/strunk/">mesoscopic
physics group, Uni Regensburg</a>. Users have reported further applications
in academic and industrial r&amp;d environments.</p>

<h2>Authors and history</h2>
<p>The Lab::VISA system was originally developed by <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/~schroeer/">Daniel Schr&ouml;er</a> and
continued by <a href="http://www.akhuettel.de/">Andreas K.
H&uuml;ttel</a>, Daniela Taubert, and Daniel Schr&ouml;er. Most of the documentation was
written by Daniel Schr&ouml;er. In 2011, the code was refactored mostly by Florian Olbrich
to include the Connection layer; subsequently the name of the entire package collection
was changed to Lab::Measurement.
